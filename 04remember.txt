Something i need to make habbit for my slef as best practces.
-------------------------------------------------------------

i should learn and practice something and write it down when every thing is
done. because noting stuff while learning will be a distract and miss leading 
for the learning time.

break the code to logical components where every component ca do its work and do it well

commenting every code --research about commenting methods.
commenting best practises
phpdoc.org

save every thing u learn live time or in end of the day.

while reading and exploring some skills take notes from the important and forgetable ones.

break ur work to peaces and commit logicaly.

Read the knowledge u gather before any project u want to start.
better method naming is requaierd.

When you read something you should test it and try it atm.
