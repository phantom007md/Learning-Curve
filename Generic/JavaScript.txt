in doing innerHTML +=  --> 	the operation would get the hole innerHTML as a string and add some string to it 
			   	and replace it as a hole new string entierly not adding the string in the buttom.
				it add the full string after modifing it.

when we are using stringtemplates and using ${} to insert some variables inside the string if the variable changed in any ways
we should re assign the stringtemplate and regenerate it in order to render the string with the changed Vars i it.

defining properties in classes is only acceptable when we need to add some properties(accessable features inside<private> or outside<public> of the class)
to the class and have a reason to add them.and bing a global variable to other methods is not a reeason.

use const if the variable is not going to change in other places and it will make the let keyword tell u im getting change somewhere!

insted of calling the method to fill a property and use the property after its nice to make the methor return the property
and call the method in a local Var.
