Namespace -->

	In gulpfile     target: 'ES5', module: 'es2015' are not needed
	
    			outFile: './dist/ts/bookingroom.js' is needed

			if u are usning a any other TS file in ur current TS file u should import it for the tsc(typescript compile)
			it is the /// <reference path="./util.ts"/> called triple slash refrecing!

			any class in the namespace should be exported using (export) keyword even if ur not refrencing it in an other class or importing it any where.
