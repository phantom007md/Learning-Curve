in giving src to gulp we should make explicit directory untill we reach the file we want to gain and ive it to gulp.
cuz otherwise if gulp.src finds any folder wich contains a file in it it will compile and create the folder while 
exporting it to gulp.dest directory.
usualy this problem occurs with the parent folders we dont give the address explicit about them.
