css possitioning.
if u give a position property to an element it will be on a different leyer and not related to other elements.
the parent wont underestand some of the child properties.

if u set right:0px left:0px;   margin :auto would work;

css units

20vw  == 20% of the viewport width;

every property in css got its own default value and this is usefull when u want to reset som property

content '' as noyhing is needed.

groupe the css styles u write to gather and shorter lines should be set to highier state.
