Fecade pattern
-------------------------------------------
this pattern used to provide a simplified interface to a complicated system.

1)fecade is a fron of a building. we dont see the nastyness indside the 
building happening. we just see a nice clean fron wall to the building.
it can be other chaos inside the building but we dont see that.

2)fecade hides the complixity for us

3)simplifies tyhe interface
jquery is a fecade gives us cleane interfac e to work with the DOM.
