pubsub is a static calss has methods called subscribe/on and publish/emit.

an component would subscribe to the events and add an event to the events object inside the pubsub
class.
so any module can add an event to the class and subscribe the event there. with the clusure of 
Javascript the listeners (functions listen to the event and fire after the event happens) will
run with the context they where in when where subscribed.\

some other component will emit the event and tell the pubsub class(object) to run the event it 
holds
the pubsub object will trigger the listeners witch where subscribed by other components.
