Array.prototype.reduce()

arr.reduce(callback, [initialValue]);

callback
Function to execute on each element in the array, taking four arguments:

accumulator
The accumulator accumulates the callback's return values; it is the accumulated
value previously returned in the last invocation of the callback, or 
initialValue, if supplied (see below).

currentValue
The current element being processed in the array.

currentIndex
The index of the current element being processed in the array. Starts at index 
0, if an initialValue is provided, and at index 1 otherwise.

array
The array reduce was called upon.
initialValue
[Optional] Value to use as the first argument to the first call of the callback.
If no initial value is supplied, the first element in the array will be used. 
Calling reduce on an empty array without an initial value is an error.
