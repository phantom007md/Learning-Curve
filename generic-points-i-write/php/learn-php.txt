Singly quoted strings are treated almost literally, whereas doubly quoted 
strings replace variables with their values as well as specially interpreting 
certain character sequences.

-Certain character sequences beginning with backslash (\) are replaced with 
special characters

-Variable names (starting with $) are replaced with string representations of 
their values.

"the $somevar will print the value of the somevar in the middle of the string"
"the {$somevar} will print the value of the somevar in the middle of the string"

\n is replaced by the newline character
\r is replaced by the carriage-return character
\t is replaced by the tab character
\$ is replaced by the dollar sign itself ($)
\" is replaced by a single double-quote (")
\\ is replaced by a single backslash (\)

Static Variables
The final type of variable scoping that I discuss is known as static. In 
contrast to the variables declared as function parameters, which are destroyed
 on the function's exit, a static variable will not lose its value when the 
function exits and will still hold that value should the function be called 
again.
-----------------------------------------------------
Differences between constants and variables are
There is no need to write a dollar sign ($) before a constant, where as in 
Variable one has to write a dollar sign.

Constants cannot be defined by simple assignment, they may only be defined 
using the define() function.

Constants may be defined and accessed anywhere without regard to variable 
scoping rules.

Once the Constants have been set, may not be redefined or undefined.

define("MINSIZE", 50);
   
   echo MINSIZE;
   echo constant("MINSIZE"); // same thing as the previous line
-----------------------------------------------------
__LINE__

The current line number of the file.

2	
__FILE__

The full path and filename of the file. If used inside an include,the name of 
the included file is returned. Since PHP 4.0.2, __FILE__ always contains an 
absolute path whereas in older versions it contained relative path under some 
circumstances.

3	
__FUNCTION__

The function name. (Added in PHP 4.3.0) As of PHP 5 this constant returns the function name as it was declared (case-sensitive). In PHP 4 its value is always lowercased.

4	
__CLASS__

The class name. (Added in PHP 4.3.0) As of PHP 5 this constant returns the 
class name as it was declared (case-sensitive). In PHP 4 its value is always 
lowercased.

5	
__METHOD__

The class method name. (Added in PHP 5.0.0) The method name is returned as it 
was declared (case-sensitive).
-----------------------------------------------------
To concatenate two string variables together, use the dot (.) operator âˆ’
-----------------------------------------------------
echo strlen("Hello world!"); // length of the string.
echo strpos("Hello world!","world"); //  is used to search for a string or 
										 character within a string.
-----------------------------------------------------
The PHP header() function supplies raw HTTP headers to the browser and can be used to redirect it to another location. The redirection script should be at the very top of the page to prevent any other part of the page from loading.

The target is specified by the Location: header as the argument to the header() function. After calling this function the exit() function can be used to halt parsing of rest of the code.

<?php
   if( $_POST["location"] ) {
      $location = $_POST["location"];
      header( "Location:$location" );
      
      exit();
   }
?>
